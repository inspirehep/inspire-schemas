User's Guide
------------

This part of the documentation will show you how to get started in using
inspire-schemas.

**NOTE**: it is highly encouraged to pin the version of ``inspire-schemas``
that you use to the major number, for example using the ``~=`` version matcher
in your ``requirements.txt`` or your ``setup.py`` like::

  inspire-schemas~=1.0.0

That will prevent any major update (compatibility breaking) to be pulled
automatically, and will only download minor and feature updates (1.X.Y).
