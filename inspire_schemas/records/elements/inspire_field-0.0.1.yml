    :MARC: ``65017`` with ``2:INSPIRE``

    The Inspire category (also called field category) classifies the subject
    this record is related to.  This classification schema is similar to the
    arXiv one (see `elements/arxiv_categories.json`) and there is a way to map
    from arXiv categories to Inspire categories.
