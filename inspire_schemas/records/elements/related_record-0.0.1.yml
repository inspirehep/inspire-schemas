        title: URL of related record
    relation:
        description: |-
            The possible values are:

            ``predecessor``
                :MARC: ``510__w:a`` (if not a Literature record) or the field
                    comes from ``78002`` (for Literature).

                The related record is a predecessor of the current one, i.e.
                the current record supersedes the related one.

                - For a Literature record, this is typically the case if the
                  related record is a preliminary note and this record is the
                  final version.
                - For a Journal record, this happens when the journal has
                  changed name: the related record has the previous name and
                  this one the new name.
                - For an Institution record, this means that the related record
                  represents an institution that does no longer exist and has
                  become the one represented by this record.
                - For a Project record, this happens when the related record is
                  a project that finished and was superseded by the one in this
                  record (e.g. two successive runs of an experiment).

            ``parent``
                :MARC: ``510__w:t`` (for an Institution record)

                The related record is the parent of the current one, i.e. the
                current record is a child of the related one.

                - For an Institution record, this means that the related record
                  represents a parent institution (e.g. a university if this
                  record is a department).

            ``commented``
                :MARC: ``78708i:commented`` (for a Literature record)

                The related record has been commented by the current one, i.e.
                the current record is a comment on the related one.

                .. note::

                   This only makes sense for a Literature record.


            If none of the relations apply, a free textual relation can be
            provided in :ref:`relation_freetext`.

            .. note::

                Only one directional links are currently allowed for technical
                reasons, but this should change in the future when Inspire can
                handle atomic updates of the two directions. For example,
                ``78502`` is currently discarded.
