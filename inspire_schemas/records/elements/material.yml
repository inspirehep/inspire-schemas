    The possible values are:

    ``addendum``
        for a document extending the main publication.

    ``additional material``
        for additional material attached to the main publication, that is
        neither the more specific ``data`` or ``software``.

    ``data``
        for a dataset related to the main publication (for Literature) or to
        the dataset itself (for Data). If the data is versioned, this refers to
        the aggregate, unversioned dataset.

    ``erratum``
        for a document correcting errors in the content of the main
        publication. When the errors are not in the content but in the
        publication process, it is considered as an ``editorial note`` instead.

    ``editorial note``
        for a document correcting errors in the metadata of the publication but
        not its content. Otherwise, it is an ``erratum``.

    ``preprint``
        for a document that is made public (typically on `arXiv
        <http://arxiv.org>`_) but not yet published formally.

    ``publication``
        for the main publication. If it's not published, it's a ``preprint``.

    ``part``
        for a part of the main record. This is used for subsets of datasets,
        e.g. a single table.

    ``reprint``
        for a reprint of the main publication.

    ``software``
        for software related to the main publication.

    ``translation``
        for a translation of the main publication.

    ``version``
        for a version of the main record. This is used for example for versions of datasets.
