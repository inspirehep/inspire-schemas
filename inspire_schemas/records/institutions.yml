            HEP affiliation unique identifier following the general pattern
            ``institution name, city, department``. This was called the "new ICN"
            on legacy.

                This is a list in case the ICN needs to be updated because of a
                mistake in its assignment.  The current one is the first
                element of the list.

            List of records that were deleted because they were replaced by
            this one. This typically happens when merging two records: one of
            them gets enriched with the information of the other one, which is
            then superfluous and gets deleted.
