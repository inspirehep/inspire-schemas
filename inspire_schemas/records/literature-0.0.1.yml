            :MARC: ``true`` corresponds to ``980__a:Citeable``.

            The main effect of setting this field to ``true`` is that the
            recoord is taken into account in the citation summary.  The need
            for this field arises because of limitations in the automatic
            recognition of cited papers in references: a record is flagged as
            citeable only if the common way to cite this record can be reliably
            recognized.  Currently, a record is automatically flagged as
            citeable if it has

            - sufficient information in :ref:`publication_info`:
                :ref:`publication_info/items/properties/journal_title`,
                :ref:`publication_info/items/properties/journal_volume` and
                (:ref:`publication_info/items/properties/artid` or
                :ref:`publication_info/items/properties/page_start`), *or*
            - an :ref:`arxiv_eprints` field.

            Besides, a record may be manually flagged as citeable by a curator
            if a user tracks and reports citations to that record.

                As a record aggregates information from multiple sources, it
                can have multiple document types simultaneously.

            ``article``
                An article, whether it is published or only a preprint. In the
                first case, :ref:`publication_info` contains information about the
                journal in which it was published.

            ``book``
                A monograph that does not fit into any other
                :ref:`document_type`.  The :ref:`editions`, :ref:`imprints`,
                :ref:`isbns` and :ref:`book_series` fields may contain specific
                metadata about this book.

                .. note::

                    A ``proceeding`` or a ``thesis`` is not considered as a ``book``.

            ``book chapter``
                A chapter in a book. The field :ref:`publication_info` contains
                information about the book of which this record is a chapter.

            ``conference paper``
                A paper that part of a conference proceedings. The field
                :ref:`publication_info` contain information about the
                conference proceedings. In particular,
                :ref:`publication_info/items/properties/cnum` contains the identifier
                of the conference.

            ``note``
                A note, not meant for publication.

            ``proceedings``
                Proceedings of a conference. The
                :ref:`publication_info/items/properties/cnum` field contains the
                identfier of the conference. If published in a journal,
                :ref:`publication_info` also contains the journal information.
                If published as a book, the :ref:`editions`, :ref:`imprints`,
                :ref:`isbns` and :ref:`book_series` fields may contain specific
                metadata about this book.

            ``report``
                A report.

            ``thesis``
                A thesis. The :ref:`thesis_info` field contains additional
                information about the thesis. If published as a book, the
                :ref:`editions`, :ref:`imprints`, :ref:`isbns` and

            assessment might differ from the journal's claim to do peer review.
            As a consequence, most conference papers are not considered as
            refereed.
