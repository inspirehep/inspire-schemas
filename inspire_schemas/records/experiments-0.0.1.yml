            - When ``collaboration`` is present, the :ref:`collaboration` field

              accelerator/experiment.
            - When ``experiment`` is present, the :ref:`experiment` field
              contains information about it.
            - When ``accelerator`` is present, the :ref:`accelerator` field
              contains information about it. If not, but ``experiment`` is
              present, it might refer to the accelerator record providing a beam to
              this experiment.
