            A project can represent a combination of ``collaboration``, ``accelerator`` and ``experiment``,
            depending on the contents of this field. Typical cases are:

            - When ``collaboration`` is present, the :ref:`collaboration` field
              contains information about it. Otherwise, it might refer to the
              collaboration record corresponding to the current
              accelerator/experiment.
            - When ``experiment`` is present, the :ref:`experiment` field
              contains information about it.
            - When ``accelerator`` is present, the :ref:`accelerator` field
              contains information about it. If not, but ``experiment`` is
              present, it might refer to the accelerator record providing a beam to
              this experiment.
