            :MARC: ``981__a``

            List of records that were deleted because they were replaced by
            this one. This typically happens when merging two records: one of
            them gets enriched with the information of the other one, which is
            then superfluous and gets deleted.

            For the opposite concept, see :ref:`new_record`.
