            :MARC: ``980__a`` (``HEP`` maps to ``Literature``)

            Regular Literature records have collection ``Literature`` only.

            The other collections are used by different groups to manage
            records using the Inspire infrastructure, but which do not belong
            to the Inspire literature collection. If a record belongs to one
            of these collections but not ``Literature``, it is not shown in the
            standard search results.

            :MARC: ``true`` corresponds to ``980__a:Citeable``.

            The main effect of setting this field to ``true`` is that the
            recoord is taken into account in the citation summary.  The need
            for this field arises because of limitations in the automatic
            recognition of cited papers in references: a record is flagged as
            citeable only if the common way to cite this record can be reliably
            recognized.  Currently, a record is automatically flagged as
            citeable if it has

            - sufficient information in :ref:`publication_info`:
                :ref:`publication_info/items/properties/journal_title`,
                :ref:`publication_info/items/properties/journal_volume` and
                (:ref:`publication_info/items/properties/artid` or
                :ref:`publication_info/items/properties/page_start`), *or*
            - an :ref:`arxiv_eprints` field.

            Besides, a record may be manually flagged as citeable by a curator
            if a user tracks and reports citations to that record.

                    A ``proceeding`` or a ``thesis`` is not considered as a ``book``.

            ``book chapter``

                :ref:`publication_info` contain information about the
                conference proceedings. In particular,
                :ref:`publication_info/items/properties/cnum` contains the identifier
                of the conference.

            ``note``
                A note, not meant for publication.

            ``proceedings``
                Proceedings of a conference. The
