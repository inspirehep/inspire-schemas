            several cities.

            Sometimes conferences are known by several titles/acronyms. These
            name variants can be provided here.

            .. note::

                If a conference has several titles or acronyms, it is more
                appropriate to use :ref:`titles` or :`acronyms`.

                This field is meant mainly to port information from legacy, that
                was not categorized well into title/acronym variants and was
                used to boost search results.

            then superfluous and gets deleted.
